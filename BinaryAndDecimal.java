/*
 Create a program in which you define the following methods:
binary2decimal(String): takes from the user a binary number (with digits 0 and 1) and returns the corresponding
number in decimal (base-10, with digits between 0 and 9). Hint: in the same way that you know that
35 = 3  101 + 5  100
, you can find that 100011 = 1  2
5 + 1  2
1 + 1  2
0
.
decimal2binary(int): the opposite of the previous one: takes a decimal number and returns the corresponding
binary number. Hint: instead of multiplying by 2, you will need to divide by two this time.
The program must offer a menu to the user with two options. The first one takes a binary number from the
user and returns the corresponding decimal number. The second one does the opposite: takes a decimal number
and returns a binary number. The program should use the methods defined.
